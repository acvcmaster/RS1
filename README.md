# RS1

## Introduction

> Rust Station 1 (or simply RS1) is a minimal and very rudimentary PS1 emulator written in Rust. I'm mainly working in this project to learn more about emulators in general and about the Rust programming language.

## Usage

```sh
    $ rs1 --bios scph1001.bin --kernel game.bin
```
